		Note that this verb is treated as the default type of verb. It is the reflex of the conjugation class that had a theme vowel /e/ in Classical Armenian. Such verbs are also the default type of verb in SEA and SWA. Philological work calls it the first class; a more mnemonic name is  the E-Class. }}

And because I don't speak this dialect, I don't understand the text samples well enough to translate or annotate. In some cases, the printed letter was unclear so I rendered it as `X'. }}
