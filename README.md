# Translation of Adjarian 1911
This is an ongoing translation of Adjarian 1911 "Armenian dialectology", written in LaTeX, and compiled as a [PDF](/adjarian1911.pdf). The original manuscript from 1911 is available on [Nayiri](http://www.nayiri.com/imagedBook.jsp?id=1) and at the [Fundamental Scientific Library](https://www.flib.sci.am/journal/eminian/1911-8.html). Neither version is however OCRed. 

The current version uses the LaTeX templates from the Language Science Press, for better aesthetics.

The final version  will hopefully be correct enough to comfortably publish, eventually.
