# Translation of Adjarian 1911
This is an ongoing translation of Adjarian 1911 "Armenian dialectology", written in LaTeX. The original manuscript from 1911 is available on [Nayiri](http://www.nayiri.com/imagedBook.jsp?id=1) and at the [Fundamental Scientific Library](https://www.flib.sci.am/journal/eminian/1911-8.html). Neither version is however OCRed. 

The current version has all of Adjarian's main prose and data, along with my commentary. It has been taking me a while to get this far, so I figure it's more practical to make my current version available as I continue to work on it.

The next version will do the following:
* correct or finish TODO statements,
*  add my own introduction, 
* move some of notes from Adjarian's prose into my own introduction, and
*  double-check the translation's correctness.

The final version  will hopefully be correct enough to comfortably publish, eventually.
